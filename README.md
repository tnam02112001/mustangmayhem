# Mustang Mayhem
Mustang Mayhem is a 2D endless-arcade game developed by me and my teammate Brett Gowling in March 2020. With the main goal of honoring the mascot of Cal Poly, we decided to choose Musty the Mustang as the main character of this game.

## Gameplay
The goal of our game is simple: Don't die!
You are a Mustang in a world of vehicles traveling at deadly speeds, and your job is to survive. Using the arrow keys, you must maneuver around benches, rocks, and cars coming from both your left and right. The stage is constantly moving, and if your character falls behind, it is game over. 

Additionally, the longer the game runs, which also translates to the farther you travel, the faster the cars will drive, making it more difficult to progress. There is also an additional factor that you must consider during your journey: The Hunter. The Hunter is always chasing you, and if he catches you, game over.

Unfortunately, dying is inevitable, but it is your job to survive for as long as possible. Your score is determined by how far you travel vertically. Enjoy!

## Supported Operating System
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Linux distros with [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/) preinstalled on all platforms.
